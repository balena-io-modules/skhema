    - subject: Drop support for node versions prior to v12
      hash: 1c0a31691eec10579eaedf8b555804487b99fd68
      body: |
        We only test for versions 12, 14 and 16 and the recent update to
        lru-cache also means the package won't support node versions less than
        10. This change makes sense to ensure consistent behaviour that we can
        provide some level of assurance for.

      body: |
        This update was a major change to the lru-cache dependency. AFAICT the
        interface remains the same, and the breaking change is that only node
        versions >= 10 are supported now.

        This is a hack, and should be reverted once we get to the bottom of it.
        It will impact performance, but right now there are things that should
        be filtered and are not, so lets get this merged for security purposes.
        Hopefully this library will be re-written soon.
